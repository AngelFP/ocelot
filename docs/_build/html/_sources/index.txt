OCELOT Documentation
====================

Overview
--------
OCELOT is a framework for synchrotron light source and FEL design and operation.


Ocelot is a multiphysics simulation toolkit designed for studying FEL and storage ring based light sources.
Ocelot is written in Python. Its central concept is the writing of python's scripts for simulations with the usage of
Ocelot's modules and functions and the standard Python libraries.

Ocelot includes following main modules:

* **Charged particle beam dynamics module (CPBD)**
    - optics
    - tracking
    - matching
    - collective effects
        - Space Charge (true 3D Laplace solver)
        - CSR (Coherent Synchrotron Radiation) (1D model with arbitrary number of dipoles) (under development).
        - Wakefields (Taylor expansion up to second order for arbitrary geometry).
    - MOGA (Multi Objective Genetics Algorithm). (under development but we have already applied it for a storage ring `application <http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/AccelConf/ipac2016/papers/thpmb034.pdf>`_
* **Native module for spontaneous radiation calculation**
* **FEL calculations: interface to GENESIS and pre/post-processing**
* **Modules for online beam control and online optimization of accelerator performances.** `Work1 <http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/IPAC2014/papers/mopro086.pdf>`_ , `work2 <https://jacowfs.jlab.org/conf/y15/ipac15/prepress/TUPWA037.PDF>`_ , `work3 <http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/AccelConf/ipac2016/papers/wepoy036.pdf>`_ .

Ocelot extensively  uses Python's `NumPy (Numerical Python <http://numpy.org>`_ and `SciPy (Scientific Python) <http://scipy.org>`_ libraries,
which enable efficient in-core numerical and scientific computation within Python and give you access to various mathematical and optimization techniques and algorithms.
To produce high quality figures Python's `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/index.html>`_ library is used.

It is an open source project and it is being developed by physicists from  `The European XFEL <http://www.xfel.eu/>`_ , `DESY <http://www.desy.de/>`_ (Germany), `NRC Kurchatov Institute <http://www.nrcki.ru/>`_ (Russia).
